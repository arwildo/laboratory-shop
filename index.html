                <h3>Microscopes</h3>
                <p>A microscope is an instrument used to see objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. 
                    Microscopy is the science of investigating small objects and structures using such an instrument. 
                    Microscopic means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.</p>

                <p>A graduated cylinder, measuring cylinder or mixing cylinder is a common piece of laboratory equipment
                     used to measure the volume of a liquid. It has a narrow cylindrical shape. Each marked line on the 
                     graduated cylinder represents the amount of liquid that has been measured. </p>

                <p>A Petri dish, named after the German bacteriologist Julius Richard Petri, is a shallow cylindrical glass
                     or plastic lidded dish that biologists use to culture cells – such as bacteria – or small mosses.</p>

                <p>An Erlenmeyer flask, also known as a conical flask or a titration flask, is a type of laboratory flask 
                    which features a flat bottom, a conical body, and a cylindrical neck. It is named after the German chemist
                     Emil Erlenmeyer, who created it in 1860.</p>

                <h3>Analytical Balance</h3>
                <p>An analytical balance is a class of balance designed to measure small mass in the sub-milligram range. 
                    The measuring pan of an analytical balance is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that dust does 
                    not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation.</p>
